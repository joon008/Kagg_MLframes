From being engineering institutions to becoming full-fledged universities, IITs have evolved over the years, he said.  ''We are going through a complete review of our curriculum so that we can enhance the student experience. The exercise is being conducted after over a decade. Over the last several years, IITs have moved from being predominantly undergraduate and engineering institutions to full-fledged universities offering a wide range of courses,'' he said.  ''We are trying to provide in our curriculum, challenges and opportunities for students to engage with the real world and hence a complete revamp was needed. So, hopefully, next year we should be able to see many changes. Right now we are doing extensive consultation with faculty, students and alumni,'' he added.\n"},{"name":"stdout","text":"\n\nLR Prediction: Fake News \nDT Prediction: Fake News \nGBC Prediction: Fake News \nRFC Prediction: Fake News\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"news = str(input())\nmanual_testing(news)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-10-06T08:11:45.280262Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-10-06T08:11:45.280776Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-10-06T08:13:17.103632Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-10-06T08:11:45.280738Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-10-06T08:13:17.102683Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":45,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdin","text":" This brief formal ceremony was followed by a collective welcoming ceremony and a delightful interactive session between him and the IITGN community that served as a medium to know more about Professor Rajat Moona, his work so far, and his interests.
